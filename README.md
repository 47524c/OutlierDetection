Python3 file DataStats.py can be used to print out stats.
Lowest value =  1.7
Highest value =  11.95
Average =  2.82
Median =  2.15
Q1 =  1.92
Q3 =  3.04
IQR =  1.12
Multiplier =  2.2
Min value =  0
Max value =  5.5
NB. Values less than min value and greater than max value are traditionally defined as outliers.
